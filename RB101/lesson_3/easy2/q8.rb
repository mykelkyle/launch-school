# Shorten the following sentence:

advice = "Few things in life are as important as house training your pet dinosaur."

# Review the String#slice! documentation, and use that method to make the return value "Few things in life are as important as ". But leave the advice variable as "house training your pet dinosaur.".

# As a bonus, what happens if you use the String#slice method instead?

p advice.slice!(0..38)
p advice

# more efficient solution

advice.slice!(0, advice.index("house"))
