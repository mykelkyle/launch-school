/*
Given an array of integers, nums, return the third largest number in the array. If the third largest number does not exist, return the greatest number.

You are not allowed to sort the array.
*/

/*
Potential Questions:
  - Can I use the sort method elsewhere in the code or not at all?
  - Will the array always contain Number/Integer types?
  - What about other special number values such as NaN, Infinity?
  - Will the array ever be empty?
  - Will there always be precisely one argument?
  - Will the argument always be an array?
  - Can the array be sparse?
  - How should I handle negative numbers or 0?
  - How to handle duplicate numbers, eg [3, 3, 1] Should I handle the two 3s as different numbers and return 1, or return the largest number 3?
