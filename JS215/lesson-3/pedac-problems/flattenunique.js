/*
Potential Questions:
  - Will there always be exactly one argument?
  - Will the argument always an Array type?
  - Will the argument always be a two-dimensional array?
  - Will the array every be empty or have more than two nested arrays?
  - Will there be any sparse arrays?
  - If I can treat 1 and '1' as duplicates, can I also treat other values similarly? eg true and 'true' or 0 and '' (both falsey) [] and '[]'
  - Can I mutate the original array?
  - Can the array contain any other values besides numbers and strings? What about complex data types?
  - Can I expect to see any special Number values such as Infinity or NaN?
  - What if there are no duplicate values? Should I return an empty array?
