/*
Potential Questions:
  - Will there always be exactly one argument?
  - Will the argument always be a string?
  - Will the string always contain numbers within?
  - What do we return if the string only contains non-number characters?
  - Will the string argument ever be empty?
  - Can the string be of any length?
  - Do we always need to return an array?
  - What if the string contains negative numbers?
  - If the string has adjacent digits like 13, should I consider that as 13 as well as 1 and 3?
  - In what order should the numbers be listed in the output array?
