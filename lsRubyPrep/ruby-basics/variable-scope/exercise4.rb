# Numbers are immutable, and assignment merely changes the object that a variable references. However, strings are mutable - they can be modified - and, in particular, the method String#[]= is a mutating method; it actually modifies the string. Since we are actually modifying the string referenced by b, and b references the same string as a, the result from printing a shows and update to the value of the string.
